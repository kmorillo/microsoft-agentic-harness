/// <summary>
/// Represents an exception thrown when a requested skill cannot be found or loaded.
/// This exception provides structured context about which skill was requested and
/// from which source it was expected to be available.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Skills are first-class components in the agentic harness, loaded from multiple sources
/// (bundled, filesystem, MCP servers). This exception is semantically distinct from
/// <see cref="Application.Common.Exceptions.ExceptionTypes.EntityNotFoundException"/>
/// because skills have source-awareness and their absence may indicate a configuration
/// issue rather than a data issue. Common scenarios include:
/// <list type="bullet">
///   <item><description>A skill referenced in an agent manifest (AGENT.md) does not exist</description></item>
///   <item><description>A filesystem skill directory is missing or inaccessible</description></item>
///   <item><description>An MCP server failed to expose an expected skill</description></item>
///   <item><description>A bundled skill was disabled by configuration</description></item>
///   <item><description>A skill name was misspelled in a tool declaration</description></item>
/// </list>
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// var skill = skillRegistry.Find(skillName)
///     ?? throw new SkillNotFoundException(skillName, "filesystem");
