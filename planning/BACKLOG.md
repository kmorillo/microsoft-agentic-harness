## Observability / Agent-assisted Debugging

### Telemetry MCP Server (diagnostic surface for in-session debugging)

**Rationale.** AgentHub already emits rich telemetry — OTLP traces/metrics to `localhost:4317`, a `SignalRSpanExporter`, PII filtering, LLM token tracking, rate limiting, tail-based sampling. None of it is currently reachable by a developer assistant (Claude, Copilot, etc.) without the human pasting logs into the chat. The dev-loop tax is real: every troubleshooting turn requires the human to manually shuttle log excerpts.

A log file sink (Serilog → `logs/agenthub-{date}.ndjson`) was added as a tactical fix so assistants can `Read` / `Grep` structured JSON. That's sufficient for ad-hoc debugging but does not surface traces, span relationships, LLM cost data, or tool-invocation timing.

**Proposal.** Build an MCP server that wraps the existing telemetry infrastructure and exposes it as MCP tools. This fits the project's MCP-first posture and lets any MCP-aware assistant self-serve diagnostics.

**Candidate tools to expose:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_recent_logs(level?, since?, trace_id?)` | Tails the `.ndjson` log file with filters. |
| `get_recent_spans(since?, trace_id?, conversation_id?)` | Returns buffered spans from the `SignalRSpanExporter` pipeline. |
| `get_trace(trace_id)` | Reconstructs a trace tree from span buffer or Jaeger. |
| `get_llm_token_usage(conversation_id?, since?)` | Surfaces output from `LlmTokenTrackingProcessor`. |
| `get_tool_effectiveness(tool_name?, since?)` | Surfaces output from `ToolEffectivenessProcessor`. |
| `get_conversation_timeline(conversation_id)` | Composite view: spans + logs + tool calls + token stream timing for one turn. |

**Acceptance criteria:**
1. New project: `Infrastructure.Observability.McpServer` (keep diagnostic surface separate from `Infrastructure.AI.MCPServer` which serves production tools).
2. Dev-only registration — guarded by `IsDevelopment()` and an explicit config flag (`Diagnostics:ExposeMcp=true`).
3. Auth: reuse the dev-auth handler; never expose unauthenticated in any non-Development environment.
4. Scope: read-only. No endpoint should mutate state or replay traffic.
5. Extend to `Presentation.ConsoleUI` and `Infrastructure.AI.MCPServer` once the shape is proven.
6. Documentation: `docs/diagnostics.md` explaining how to wire it into Claude Code / Cursor / Copilot as an MCP server.

**Non-goals:**
- This is not a replacement for Jaeger, Grafana, or Azure Monitor. It is a programmatic surface for in-session agent debugging.
- No historical storage beyond what already lives in the span buffer and log files.

### Companion: OpenTelemetry Browser SDK → distributed traces

Follow-on to the current browser→`/api/client-logs` pipeline. Replace the hand-rolled log shipper with `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-web` + `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http`, pointing at the existing OTel collector (`localhost:4317` today, or a CORS-friendly proxy in dev). Benefits:

- W3C trace-context correlation: every `fetch`/SignalR call auto-injects `traceparent`, so a browser interaction ties to the server request and agent turn in one trace view.
- The telemetry MCP tools above (`get_trace`, `get_conversation_timeline`) automatically surface browser spans alongside server spans — no separate "client logs" query needed.
- Replaces `browserLogger.ts`: console wrappers keep shipping events, but they become OTel log records instead of custom POSTs.

Depends on: exposing an OTLP HTTP receiver that the browser can reach (the current gRPC endpoint at 4317 is browser-unfriendly). Likely an `http/protobuf` receiver on the collector plus CORS config.

**Estimated effort.** ~2–3 hours (scaffold new project + implement 3 tools + docs). Remaining tools can land incrementally.

**Why deferred.** Scope too large for the current debugging session. Log file sink (Serilog) provides 80% of the immediate value; this is the "right" answer when a future session focuses on diagnostics tooling rather than fixing a specific bug.

## Documentation

### Release Notes page

**Rationale.** The harness ships as a template that enterprise consumers clone and track over time. There is no single page that records what changed between versions (new providers, config sections, breaking changes, dependency bumps). Consumers currently have to read the git log to understand what a given update brings — which doesn't surface migration steps or breaking changes clearly.

**Proposal.** Add a `Release Notes` page alongside the existing documentation set (`documentation/`), deployed via the GitHub Pages workflow. Group entries by version/date; for each release call out: new features, config/`AppConfig` additions, dependency changes, breaking changes, and required migration steps.

**Acceptance criteria:**
1. New page (e.g. `documentation/release-notes/` or a top-level `RELEASE-NOTES.md`) wired into the Pages deploy (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`).
2. Reverse-chronological entries with a stable heading format (version or date).
3. Each entry distinguishes Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Breaking (Keep a Changelog style).
4. Backfill at least the recent notable changes (e.g. Foundry Responses provider, multi-tenant isolation, skill-training subsystem).
5. Linked from the onboarding guide landing page.

**Why deferred.** Captured as a one-off request during the Foundry Phase 1 session; not blocking current feature work.
